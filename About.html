            <p>      What do you think about when you do not have to think?
            That question often crosses my mind as I reflect on where my mind wanders during a long shift or a boring meeting. Yrstem is a personal project wherein I undergo liberating world building. Everyone wants to write their own story, whether it be control over personal destiny, authorship of a novel, or telling fantastic tales. Yrstem is my pathway to story delivery. 
            The concept is still undergoing development as I hash out details and research historical events and geography. Some of the most well developed spaces draw inspiration from world history. Employing factual events as partial source material lends credibility to the story as a listener or reader will receive the material as believable. 
            Yrstem may even be a temporary name for the world since the development is so early, yet it is important to think about the big picture when attempting to organize a civilization, or a landmass, or a planet, or even something as simple as a modest village. 
            My goal in presenting this website is to assist in the development of Yrstem with supporter feedback and suggestions.</p>

          <p>     Yrstem is more than a traditional table-top role playing game, it is an undertaking that is burdened with glorious purpose to inspire players. 
          The world is meant to be lived in, not as a means of escape from one's own life, but an adventure that fortifies character and strengthens the teamworking spirit.
          Though ideas are still flowing, the river of creativity does not cease to run through the valleys of Yrstem. From our team at Yrstem World, 
          we offer a genuine extension of gratitude for your support in making dreams come true. </p>
